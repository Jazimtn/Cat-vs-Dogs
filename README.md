# Cats vs Dogs Classifier

This is a simple deep learning project that classifies images as either cats or dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It's a classic example in computer vision for beginners.

## Introduction

The project aims to build a classifier that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs. It uses the popular deep learning library TensorFlow along with Keras to build and train the CNN model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training consists of thousands of images of cats and dogs. You can download it from Kaggle or any other relevant source. Make sure to split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
